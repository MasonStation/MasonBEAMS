## What I’ve Been Working On  
- **Stock prediction algorithm**
  This one goes without saying

- **AI Resume Grader**  
  Built at Easy Dynamics — an AI platform that compares resumes against job personas using Microsoft AutoGen, Azure AI Foundry, and Streamlit.  
  → Reduced recruiter screening time by 93% with multi-agent scoring, prompt engineering, and a real-time UI.  

- **Autonomous Railgun Turret (Capstone)**  
  A rotational, 3D-printed electromagnetic launcher powered by a Raspberry Pi and custom PCBs.  
  → Integrated computer vision to track designated objects and fire automatically.  

- **Gas Tracker Mobile App**  
  Flutter + SQLite app to log gas spending and efficiency over time.  
  → First project where I combined mobile development with persistent data storage.
